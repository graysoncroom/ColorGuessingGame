# ColorGuessingGame
A color guessing game based on the rgb color code

Note: I was not focused on browser compatability when I made this game. It turns out that it will not tell you if you guess correctly on firefox.

This is my first javascript web app

The web app is hosted thanks to gituhub at: https://graysoncroom.github.io/ColorGuessingGame/

<b>How to Play:</b> You are given an rgb color code, from this code pick the color to which it corresponds.
